To those, however, who may not be willing to boycott doctors and medicines altogether, we will say, “As far as possible, possess your   souls in patience, and do not trouble the doctors. In case you are forced at length to call in the aid of a doctor, be sure to get a good man; then, follow his directions strictly, and do not call in another doctor, unless by his own advice. But remember, above all, that the curing of your disease does not rest ultimately in the hands of any doctor.”</p><p>— M. K. Gandhi.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
