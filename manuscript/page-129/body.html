<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">Those who have practised true <em>Brahmacharya</em> even for a short period will have seen how their body and mind improve steadily in strength and power, and they will not, at any cost, be willing to part with this treasure. I have myself been guilty of lapses even after having fully understood the value of <em>Brahmacharya</em>, and have, of course, paid dearly for it. I am filled with shame and remorse   when I think of the terrible contrast between my condition before and after these lapses. But from the errors of the past I have now learnt to preserve this treasure in tact, and I fully hope, with Godâ€™s grace, to continue to preserve it in the future; for I have in my own person, witnessed the inestimable benefits of <em>Brahmacharya</em>. I was married early in life, and had become the father of children as a mere youth. When, at length, I awoke to the reality of my situation, I found myself sunk in the lowest depths of degradation. I shall consider myself amply rewarded for writing these pages</p></div> </div>
