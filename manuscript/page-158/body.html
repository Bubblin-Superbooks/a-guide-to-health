The poultice should be removed before the mud begins to dry up; ordinarily it will last from two to three hours. Mud once used should never be used again, but a cloth once   used can be used again, after being well washed, provided it is free from blood and other dirty matter. If the poultice has to be applied to the abdomen, it should first be covered over with a warm cloth.

Otherwise, much precious time may be wasted in cases (as of scorpion-sting) where delay would be dangerous.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
