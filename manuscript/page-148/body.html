<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">give only one instance out of many that have come within my experience, in a bad case of rheumatism, a thorough cure was effected by Kuhneâ€™s system, after all other remedies had been tried, and had proved utterly ineffectual.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Dr. Kuhne holds that the heat in the abdomen abates by the application of cold water, and has, therefore, prescribed the bathing of the abdomen and the surrounding parts with thoroughly cold water. And for the greater convenience of bathing, he has devised a special kind of tin bath. This, however, is not quite indispensable; the tin tubs of an oval shape and of different sizes to suit people of different heights, available in our bazaars, will do equally well. The tub should be filled three-fourths with cold water, and the patient should seat himself in it in such a fashion that his feet and the upper part of the body remain outside the   water, and the rest of the body up to the hips inside</p></div> </div>
