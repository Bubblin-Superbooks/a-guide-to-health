<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter Ix</h4><h3>Sexual Relations</h3><p class="  start-chapter">I would specially request those who have carefully read through the book so far to read through this chapter with even greater care, and ponder well over its subject-matter. There are still several   more chapters to be written, and they will, of course, be found useful in their own way. But not one of them is nearly as important as this. As I have already said, there is not a single matter mentioned in this book which is not based on my personal experience, or which I do not believe to be strictly true.</p></div> </div>
