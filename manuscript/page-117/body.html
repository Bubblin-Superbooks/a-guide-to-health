<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Many are the keys to health, and they are all quite essential; but the one thing needful, above all others, is <em>Brahmacharya</em>. Of course, pure air, pure water, and wholesome food do contribute to health. But how can we be healthy if we expend all the health that we acquire? How can we help being paupers if we spend all the money that we earn? There can be no doubt that men and women can never be virile or strong unless they observe true <em>Brahmacharya</em>.</p><p>What do we mean by <em>Brahmacharya</em>? We mean by it that men and women should refrain from enjoying each other. That is to say, they should not touch each other with a carnal thought, they should not think of it even in their dreams. Their mutual glances should be free from all suggestion of carnality. The hidden strength that God has given us should be conserved by rigid self-discipline, and transmitted into energy and power,â€”not merely of body, but also of mind and soul.</p></div> </div>
