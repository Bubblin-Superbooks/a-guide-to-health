<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I should perhaps explain that I am not a student of Gujarati, the language of the original. I have used instead one of the two Hindi versions of the book. I should also point out that I have not attempted a literal or close translation, but only <em>a very free rendering</em> into English. In some cases, whole passages have been omitted; and occasionally only the general sense of a passage has been given. It is hoped, however, that, in no single instance has there been a <em>misinterpretation</em> of the original words.</p><p>I am aware that many errors might have crept in, as the translation had to be done in a hurry, and there was hardly anytime for revision. I hope to make a thorough revision of the book, in case a second edition is called for.</p><p>National College,<br>Trichinopoly,<br>July 1921.</p></div> </div>
